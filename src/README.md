# Source code (e.g., preprocessing, analysis pipelines)

# preprocess_1.py
This loads the original dataset, normalizes it into the correct format, and splits the audio files into more managable chunks.

Use the `--help` option for a list of possible options.

# data_explorer.py

This visualizes the preprocessing step and allows a quick peek behind the curtain.

# Pretrained.py

This runs the multi-spectral preprocessing, and tunes standard image classification to recognize the data.
